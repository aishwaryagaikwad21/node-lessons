	• Upload or add files (simulate with file names in JSON).

	• Render list of files in each category.
app.js - main entry point - starts the server and connects everything
routes/ - defines which URLs exist and which functions handle them
controllers/ - contains the ACTUAL LOGIC for those functions - reading, writing, rendering views, partials

app.js
	- entry point that configures the server
	- import express and middleware - e.g. app.use(express.json())
	- Load routers - app.use('/files', filesRouter)
	- Set the view engine
	- Start the server -> app.listen(3000)

routes/file.js
	- defines endpoints (URLs) related to files and tells Express 
		which controller function should run when that route is hit

controllers/fileController.js
	- Contains LOGIC for routes
	- Functions for reading/writing data
	- Read JSON, filter files, return response
