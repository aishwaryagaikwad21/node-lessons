EXPRESS.JS
1. to create web-server
2. to create complex http json based api (for web-apps)
3. install and use EXPRESS
4. initialise npm to install 
5. src folder - for all node scripts

const express = require('express')
const app = express() --> calling express
    When you do express(), you are invoking that function.

    It doesn’t need arguments (by default), 
    because Express knows how to set up a new app instance 
    by itself.

    What it returns is an “app object” 
    (an instance of an Express application).

app is Express application which has many built in methods
eg. app.get() - handles GET requests; app.post() - handle POST requests; app.use() - add middleware
