About NPM
1. when we installed Node, we also got NPM program installed
    on our machine. This gives us access to everything over
    at npmjs.com 
2. Before using any of these modules in our script, we take 2 steps
    a.) we have to initialised NPM in our project
    b.) we have to install all of the modules we actually want to use.

before pushing code to github ONLY delete node_modules folder and
 NOT package.json or package-lock.json. 
 To get back the node_modules folder - just write 'npm install'
